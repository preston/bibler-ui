# Angular & Bootstrap Best Practices

## Project Context

- **Frontend**: Angular with Bootstrap
- **Server**: Backend code located at `../bibler-server`
- **Goal**: Maintainable, simple, dependency-light codebase

## Angular Best Practices

- Use Angular CLI for all operations (generate, build, serve)
- Follow Angular style guide: components, services, models in separate directories
- Use TypeScript strict mode and proper typing
- For form inputs, prefer Bootstrap "floating" style for labels
- Prefer Angular services for data fetching over direct HTTP calls in components
- Use Angular routing for navigation
- Avoid jQuery when Angular alternatives exist (use Angular directives/event binding)

## Bootstrap-First Approach

- **Always use Bootstrap classes** before writing custom CSS
- Leverage Bootstrap utilities: spacing (`mb-3`, `p-4`), display (`d-flex`, `d-none`), colors (`text-primary`, `bg-light`)
- Use Bootstrap components: `nav`, `card`, `btn`, `form-control`, `table`, etc.
- Only add custom CSS when Bootstrap cannot achieve the desired result
- Prefer Bootstrap Icons over custom icon solutions

## Minimal Custom CSS

- Keep `styles.scss` minimal - most styling should come from Bootstrap classes
- Custom CSS should be:
  - Utility classes that Bootstrap doesn't provide
  - Component-specific overrides only when necessary
  - Commented-out code should be removed, not left in place
- Avoid vendor prefixes - use standard CSS properties (Angular handles autoprefixing)

## Minimal Dependencies

- Avoid adding new npm packages unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer Angular built-ins and Bootstrap over third-party libraries
- Review existing dependencies before adding new ones
- Keep `package.json` lean and well-documented

## Maintenance Focus

- Write clear, readable code over clever solutions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into services
- Document non-obvious code decisions
- Remove dead/commented code regularly
